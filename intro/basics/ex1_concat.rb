#Exercise 1
=begin
Add two strings together that, when concatenated, return your first and last name as your full name in one string.

"<Firstname> <Lastname>"

For example, if your name is John Doe, think about how you can put "John" and "Doe" together to get "John Doe".
=end

first_name = "Jason"
last_name = "Creech"
puts first_name + last_name
